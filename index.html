    <h3>BIO</h3>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Viet Nam. In 2011, I first set foot in the U.S.<br>
      I got my BS in Business Administration from Northeastern University in 2017.<br>
      Feeling stuck and not belong in the financial industry, <br>
      I decided to switch to Computer Science and found my true calling as a Software Developer. <br>
      I'm currently enrolled in the MS in CS program at my alma mater, being set to graduate in May 2021. <br>
